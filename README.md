# terraforma
A space-exploration, crafting, empire building and survival game for Linux.

*The goal of this project is to create a game in the general spirit of "No Man's Sky" and "Space Engine", but with its own unique character. The platform of choice for the game is Linux, but it could eventually be ported to other platforms (by the community).*

###Story:
"Terraforma" (name might change) is the name of a civilization of explorers. Their survival has become tied to their need for exploration and to the spread of their civilization to new, uninhabited worlds. As they spread their influence across the galaxy, their penchant for terraforming worlds opens up the door for other species, some once dormant, and others seeking a home, to emerge and populate the worlds transformed by the Terraforman explorers. As the Terraforman empire expands, so do the possibilities to discover and document new species, access and utitlize new resources, and transform worlds in different ways.

Take your Terraforman on a journey of discovery! The survival of the species depends on it!
